##Overview

All profiles defined for my own environment will be found here

##Module Description

This is my playground to doe some normal, wierd, and even unexpected things with the profiles and profile concept.

##Setup

###What profiles affects

All your nodes will be infected, misconfigured, broken etc. This module only fits my environment.  But feel free to use some of my crazy ideas.

###Setup Requirements

Experimented on Puppet Enterprise 3.7.1

###Beginning with profiles

google 'puppet roles and profiles' and start reading.

##Usage

The goal :  classify only one, and just one role to your nodes.

##Reference

Google is your friend.

##Limitations

Maybe this will work too well, or even not ?  Use on your own risk.

##Development

Just file an issue, do PR, and most of all, be patient.

##Release Notes/Contributors/Etc 

This module will change a lot, since this is a playground for trying a lot of weird, unusual stuff.
